# NNDL-MNIST
Two Deep Learning Models with softmax layer activation at the top and 'relu' on other layers using Neural Network architecture was created on the MNIST dataset.

MODEL 1:

Number of NN layers = 2

Validation Accuracy = 96.180

Validation Loss = 0.2568

Number of Trainable Parameters = 119,260


MODEL 2:

Number of NN layers = 4

Validation Accuracy = 96.550

Validation Loss = 0.1993

Number of Trainable Parameters = 200,230


Model 2 has better validation accuracy than Model 1.Therefore we observe that Model 2 has better performance.
